# NifValidator
Python NIF Validator

## About

NifValidator is a Python package designed to validate Portuguese National Identification 
Numbers (NIF). It leverages the `validators` library to ensure the NIF adheres to the 
specific format and rules of the country.

## Installation

You can install NifValidator using pip:

```bash
pip install nif-validator
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use NifValidator to validate an NIF:

```python
from nif_validator import NifValidator

# Create a NifValidator instance
validator = NifValidator()

# Validate an NIF
nif = "1234567890"
is_valid = validator.is_valid(nif)

print(f"NIF {nif} is valid: {is_valid}")
```

## Features

- **Validation**: Checks if the provided NIF is a valid Portuguese National Identification 
Number.
- **Formatting**: Provides methods to format an NIF according to standard rules (e.g., adding 
leading zeros, removing hyphens).
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid inputs by returning appropriate error 
messages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `validators` library (version 0.17.4 or later)
